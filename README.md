# SCT_ML_1 - Task on house price prediction using Linear Regression 
This project aims to estimate house prices by analyzing essential features like square footage, the number of bedrooms, and bathrooms. Utilizing Python, a linear regression model is developed and trained on a dataset from Kaggle to provide precise predictions of house prices.
